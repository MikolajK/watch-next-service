# WatchNext - Service
## About
This is the service for a personal project I refer to as WatchNext.
It uses [OMDb API](http://www.omdbapi.com/) to retrieve details of films and series.
The project has been developed as part of [Day[9] 30 Days Project](https://day9.tv/dk30/project/603a211332ade2445d9d56d2).

State: In Development

## Running
Use `mvn quarkus:dev` to run the service.
